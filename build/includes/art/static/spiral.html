      My friend Mu Sun wrote a python script generating an svg path 
      describing a logarithmic spiral in the winter of 2012.  
      I had planned to use this in a very ambitious project to plot the 
      location of various natural cycles in musical octaves, but was not 
      able to see the original vision into fruition.  
      This is a rasterization of the output of his script tweaked to show 
      an extremely tight spiral.  It is a bit like staring directly into 
      the sun.
