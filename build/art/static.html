          These are a couple of images that I produced accidentally while doing 
          some calculations.  They seem visually pleasing enough to call art.

              I developed a technique for creating this sort of image in 2007 while 
              using a graphing calculator in Windows XP.  I was graphing simple sine 
              waves for the first ten partials of the harmonic series, with each 
              partial in a different color.  overlaying the resulting image on a 
              cropped photograph of an electric bass neck yielded a map for finding 
              the precise locations of harmonic nodes on an equal tempered fretboard.

              While I was dialing in the range of the sine wave graph I decided to 
              experiment with very high values on the x axis.  As the calculator 
              struggled to render wavelengths far smaller than its pixel matrix 
              would allow, very interesting patterns emerged.  Some were chaotic, 
              but a few were very pleasant wave forms.  I learned to fine tune 
              promising patterns and adjust the color schemes.  The finished images 
              were often reminiscent of the rolling hills of the Palouse where I was 
              born.

              All of the original run of these images are now lost, though a few 
              small prints survive.  I created this one in 2014 using an old XP 
              machine running the same graphing calculator program as the originals.  
              The image is made up of many vertical bars of solid color interacting 
              to create regions of different color mixtures.  It is 
              particularly beautiful when viewed without antialiasing as a very large 
              print or on a very large screen.

              My friend Mu Sun wrote a python script generating an svg path 
              describing a logarithmic spiral in the winter of 2012.  
              I had planned to use this in a very ambitious project to plot the 
              location of various natural cycles in musical octaves, but was not 
              able to see the original vision into fruition.  
              This is a rasterization of the output of his script tweaked to show 
              an extremely tight spiral.  It is a bit like staring directly into 
              the sun.
